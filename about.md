  Hello, my name is Vincent. I'm a student Cal Poly Pomona with a strong interest in Offensive Security I’m passionate about understanding how systems are attacked so they can be better defended, and I enjoy diving into topics like penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and network security. 
  
  I’m currently continuing to build my skills through hands-on labs, coursework, and self-study. As I grow in this field, my goal is to develop the technical expertise and critical thinking needed to contribute meaningfully to cybersecurity teams and help organizations stay secure in an ever-evolving threat landscape.
